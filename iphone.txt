["\n\n  The iPhone 12 Pro has three cameras against the two in the iPhone 12. So there is an extra 12MP telephoto lens along with the 12MP wide and ultra wide cameras seen on the iPhone 12.

It feels better than the sleek bezel of the iPhone X, especially the 7.4mm thickness with right angles. The border is particularly stylish.The camera is awesome! The night view mode turns on automatically, and the imaging effect is really good! Video stabilization is also good!!!!!!!!The filter mode is quite good. Many Android phones are still many miles away from these tones even though there are good imitations. Apple was able to improve its tones.Image quality is perfect and there is little or no noise even in a low-light environment .** Signal, nothing to say! It is much better in iPhone 12 Pro & Wifi also .ConsThere is a problem with the hand-handling of this phone. Oh yes, the iPhone 12 is light to handle, however, it is not easy to handle. The iPhone 12 comes with metal edges and there have been multiple complaints with respect to these edges. If you handle this phone for a long time, as your hand becomes a bit moist, the metal becomes slippery. To prevent your phone from falling to the ground, you will sub-consciously tighten your grip on the phone. Several reports have shown that tightening your grip on the iPhone 12 leaves you with a scar on your palm. This means that the iPhone 12 edges are perhaps too sharp. This is a major flaw in the design of this phone that will force users to stick with a phone case. Please note that users with thick skin like mine do not experience this problem.*** The iPhone 12 battery capacity and performance are lower than the previous generation.Final VerdictOverall, I think Apple fanboys will be very comfortable with this device. There is a very serious flaw with the design though. Apple may need to make those edges smoother in subsequent remakes. For now, stick with your phone case to avoid injuries. If your skin is pretty thick like mine, then you do not have a problem. We can safely say that the network and camera of the iPhone 12 are great. However, the battery!!!, battery!!!, battery!!!. There is nothing positive about the iPhone 12 battery. It is smaller than its predecessor in all ramifications. The charging capacity is also slow.

One of the best looking phone in the market right now with a decent performance jump from 11 pro. Camera is excellent and the display is quite responsive and sharp.

It feels better than the sleek bezel of the iPhone X, especially the 7.4mm thickness with right angles. The border is particularly stylish.The camera is awesome! The night view mode turns on automatically, and the imaging effect is really good! Video stabilization is also good!!!!!!!!The filter mode is quite good. Many Android phones are still many miles away from these tones even though there are good imitations. Apple was able to improve its tones.Image quality is perfect and there is little or no noise even in a low-light environment .** Signal, nothing to say! It is much better in iPhone 12 Pro & Wifi also .ConsThere is a problem with the hand-handling of this phone. Oh yes, the iPhone 12 is light to handle, however, it is not easy to handle. The iPhone 12 comes with metal edges and there have been multiple complaints with respect to these edges. If you handle this phone for a long time, as your hand becomes a bit moist, the metal becomes slippery. To prevent your phone from falling to the ground, you will sub-consciously tighten your grip on the phone. Several reports have shown that tightening your grip on the iPhone 12 leaves you with a scar on your palm. This means that the iPhone 12 edges are perhaps too sharp. This is a major flaw in the design of this phone that will force users to stick with a phone case. Please note that users with thick skin like mine do not experience this problem.*** The iPhone 12 battery capacity and performance are lower than the previous generation.Final VerdictOverall, I think Apple fanboys will be very comfortable with this device. There is a very serious flaw with the design though. Apple may need to make those edges smoother in subsequent remakes. For now, stick with your phone case to avoid injuries. If your skin is pretty thick like mine, then you do not have a problem. We can safely say that the network and camera of the iPhone 12 are great. However, the battery!!!, battery!!!, battery!!!. There is nothing positive about the iPhone 12 battery. It is smaller than its predecessor in all ramifications. The charging capacity is also slow. I give this smartphone a pass mark in every other aspect save the battery, that is a huge minus.

Please note that users with thick skin like mine do not experience this problem.*** The iPhone 12 battery capacity and performance are lower than the previous generation.Final VerdictOverall, I think Apple fanboys will be very comfortable with this device. There is a very serious flaw with the design though. Apple may need to make those edges smoother in subsequent remakes. For now, stick with your phone case to avoid injuries. If your skin is pretty thick like mine, then you do not have a problem. We can safely say that the network and camera of the iPhone 12 are great. However, the battery!!!, battery!!!, battery!!!. There is nothing positive about the iPhone 12 battery. It is smaller than its predecessor in all ramifications. The charging capacity is also slow.

In Night Mode there is correct balance of light of a pic.This iPhone12pro can handle multiple tasks at a single time without giving the problem of hanging.The Finish from outside and also gripping in our hands is perfect.The Lidar Sensor is best as it can measure the height and width of man,electronic appliances, etc.This iPhone12pro has beated the DSLR Camera in all matters.The Video Quality of iPhone12pro is Awesome.

One of the best looking phone in the market right now with a decent performance jump from 11 pro. Camera is excellent and the display is quite responsive and sharp.

It feels better than the sleek bezel of the iPhone X, especially the 7.4mm thickness with right angles. The border is particularly stylish.The camera is awesome! The night view mode turns on automatically, and the imaging effect is really good! Video stabilization is also good!!!!!!!!The filter mode is quite good. Many Android phones are still many miles away from these tones even though there are good imitations. Apple was able to improve its tones.Image quality is perfect and there is little or no noise even in a low-light environment .** Signal, nothing to say! It is much better in iPhone 12 Pro & Wifi also .ConsThere is a problem with the hand-handling of this phone. Oh yes, the iPhone 12 is light to handle, however, it is not easy to handle. The iPhone 12 comes with metal edges and there have been multiple complaints with respect to these edges. If you handle this phone for a long time, as your hand becomes a bit moist, the metal becomes slippery. To prevent your phone from falling to the ground, you will sub-consciously tighten your grip on the phone. Several reports have shown that tightening your grip on the iPhone 12 leaves you with a scar on your palm. This means that the iPhone 12 edges are perhaps too sharp. This is a major flaw in the design of this phone that will force users to stick with a phone case. Please note that users with thick skin like mine do not experience this problem.*** The iPhone 12 battery capacity and performance are lower than the previous generation.Final VerdictOverall, I think Apple fanboys will be very comfortable with this device. There is a very serious flaw with the design though. Apple may need to make those edges smoother in subsequent remakes. For now, stick with your phone case to avoid injuries. If your skin is pretty thick like mine, then you do not have a problem. We can safely say that the network and camera of the iPhone 12 are great. However, the battery!!!, battery!!!, battery!!!. There is nothing positive about the iPhone 12 battery. It is smaller than its predecessor in all ramifications. The charging capacity is also slow. I give this smartphone a pass mark in every other aspect save the battery, that is a huge minus. From an Android fanboy point of view, the iPhone 12 battery is at best, laughable.\n\n', '\n\n  Camera is unbelievably awesome.\n\n', '\n\n  Opened it yesterday evening after an illness, its a premium device which stands out from the crowd. Every penny spent on it is worth the return. Those who can afford it, just go for it. Dont think twice. Camera - Equivalent/better out than any professional dslr.\n\n', '\n\n  I have Prebooked this iPhone12 pro and received this item on time.So after 1 month of usage I am writing the Review of this iPhone. This iPhone 12pro Is the best in all the things of mobile.The Camera Quality of This iPhone is the best in every aspects.It gives clear and stunning details of Everything of which we r taking a pic Especially in Night Mode.

The video is so smooth with correct audio.When we buy iPhone no one can move to buy smartphone,as iPhone is best in all things we need in this modern world of technology and health.\n\n', '\n\n  We purchased the product for our office use and it is working very nicely, the battery backup is also pretty good as we have continuous calls and zoom meetings.\n\n', "\n\n  The iPhone 12 Pro has three cameras against the two in the iPhone 12. So there is an extra 12MP telephoto lens along with the 12MP wide and ultra wide cameras seen on the iPhone 12. Interestingly, the telephoto and the ultra wide cameras have not really changed from the iPhone 11 times. One of the best looking phone in the market right now with a decent performance jump from 11 pro. Camera is excellent and the display is quite responsive and sharp. Only issue is it does not have a higher refresh rate but you won't feel that in a tiny bit!! Go for it!!So far the the battery is just ok I really expected longer life. So far so good!!\n\n", '\n\n  Just made an upgrade from iPhone X to iPhone 12 pro, and I‚Äôm simply so blown away by the camera of this phone, the quality of the picture it takes is so very near to that of a high end digital camera. The portrait mode, the night mode, the regular mode, wow, everything just got so much better. This is truly a camera king smartphone available on the market right now. If you are a photographer or loves taking pictures, think no further, just jump in straight with eyes closed to get this phone.The only cons I find with this phone is battery tends to be on the shorter side, other than that, everything‚Äôs just so very near to perfection! üëç\n\n', '\n\n  It‚Äôs the best iPhone yet. Camera and display is amazing.\n\n', '\n\n  Premium product\n\n', "\n\n  Display is out of the world. UI is smoother than most android smartphones. Camera is just phenomenal. Battery easily lasts a day since I'm not a heavy user. I even don't game much. Haven't felt any heating issues as well. I have never used an iPhone before but I don't think I'll ever move back to Android.
